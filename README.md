# shroomsniffer
One often asks themselves: should I eat that mushroom?

shroomsniffer is an android application created using React Native designed to identify pictures of mushrooms with a mushroom species. We trained a convolutional neural network on thousands of images of mushrooms by species, which is what will be used to run inferences on user uploaded mushrooms.
